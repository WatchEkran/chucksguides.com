chucksguides.com is currently hosted on Cloudflare Pages, which has a hard limit of 20,000 files per project. To keep
under that limit, the page files and images have been moved to Cloudflare R2. The files in this folder are the ones that
were moved to Cloudflare R2 so that they don't count against the file limit for Cloudflare Pages.
